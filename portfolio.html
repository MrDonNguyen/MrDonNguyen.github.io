<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>I made this game because I love playing FPS games which were Duck hunt and Counter Strike and I want the gamers to enjoy</p>
<p>If I had more time making the game, I will add codes to make better graphics to make the game look alot better</p>
<hr>

<h1>Success</h1>
<o1>
	<li>Great sound is played when clicking on objects</li>
	<li>Finding great backdrops for our theme</li>
	
</o1> <hr>
<h1>Obstacles</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Trying to get the audio into the game</li>
	<li>Having alot of sprites and doing alot of codes for each performing specfic tasks</li>
	
</ol><hr>
<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<p>An algorithm that was important for our game is the mouse detection. This algorithm allows us to click on objects giving us results of gaining points,creating sounds and displaying losing screens.</p>

<p>For our game we have created a story which explains a battle between Phu and Don. The gamer must pick options given by the game to give Don the main character to do certain actions to determine in order to win the game. </p>

<p>For our story program, the way we plan the game is by creating a timeline of the story using google drawing to have a good idea what to put down for our code. 
Once we have the plan, we then put down scenes that we want and put options for the gamer to pick last. The difficulties that we faced was organizing for the correct scenes for each option for the gamer to pick and the sentences being cut off from the game. 
We were able to fix the problems by doing many trial and error by running the program so its easier to fix one problem at a time. 
Our story is a form of abstraction because many there are many scenes that we need to organize for each scene and doing abstraction prevents too many codes to be made. 
I think the story I enjoyed playing was Crazy Rich Asian game since it has a lot of options for the user to pick from and having an unpredictable mind of winning the game.</p>
